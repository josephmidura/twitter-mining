Existing approaches to sentiment analysis can be grouped into three main
categories: knowledge-based techniques, statistical methods, and hybrid
approaches.[25] Knowledge-based techniques classify text by affect categories
based on the presence of unambiguous affect words such as happy, sad, afraid,
and bored.[26] Some knowledge bases not only list obvious affect words, but
also assign arbitrary words a probable "affinity" to particular emotions.[27]
Statistical methods leverage on elements from machine learning such as latent
semantic analysis, support vector machines, "bag of words" and Semantic
Orientation â€” Pointwise Mutual Information
